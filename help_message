Hi! I'm Colette, the better Telegram bot. I'm an open-source project created by Ted Davis and you can view my code here 
 https://github.com/teddavis4/colette

I can also do a lot of stuff like save messages as quotes, save pictures, search for stuff on Google and lots of other cool things!

Commands:

Google searches

`/google search term`

You can do quick Google searches by sending `/google search term` and I'll try to find the most relevant Google result and send the link to the chat. If nothing matches, I'll just send the results page. Exercise your Google-fu!

Saving messages

```/quote 
/getquote
   -l username
   -s text```

You can save quotes in the chat by replying to the message with the command `/quote`. This will save the quote to my internal database. You can then retrieve saved quotes by using the `/getquote` command. `/getquote` with no arguments will return a random quote, adding `-l username` will return the most recently saved quote for the user specified. You can also search for quotes by adding -s and a search term and I will search for a quote that contains the word or words (Example /getquote -s funny). You can also use `-s username` to return quotes from a specific user. If no quotes exist with the specified words, I won't say anything.

Saving pictures

```/seve
   tags

/git
   -i ID#
   -t tag```

I can save pictures as well. Reply to a picture with the command `/seve` and I'll make a note of the picture ID and save it for later. If you want to tag the photo, add tags after the command like `/seve cool picture`. When you want to retrieve a picture, you can send `/git`, which I'll respond to with a random picture from my database. If you want to see a specific picture, you can use the `/git -t tags` string for return photos with specific tags or the `/git -i ##` where the ## is the ID number of the picture, which can be seen in my original seve confirmation message.

Getting stock quotes

```/stock
  ticker```


I'll can return current stock prices with the command `/stock TICKER` where ticker is replaced with a ticker ID, such as FB, AAPL, etc. These prices are current market and do not reflect after-hours or pre-market trading.
