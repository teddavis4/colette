Hi! I'm Colette, the better Telegram bot. I'm an open-source project created by Ted Davis and you can view my code here 
 https://github.com/teddavis4/colette

I can also do a lot of stuff like save messages as quotes, save pictures, search for stuff on Google and lots of other cool things!

Commands:

**Google searches**

You can do quick Google searches by sending "/google search term" (minus quotes) and I'll find the most relevant Google result and send the link to the chat.

Example: /google miserable failure

**Saving and retrieving messages**

You can save quotes in the chat by replying to the message with the command /quote or /quip. This will save the quote to my internal database. There is no confirmation for this command

Examples: /quote, /quip

 You can retrieve saved messages by using /getquote. This command with no arguments will return a random quote. Adding -l <username> will return the most recently saved quote for the user specified. Adding -s + search term and I will search for a quote that contains the word or words. You can also use -s username to return quotes from a specific user. If no quotes exist with the specified words, I won't say anything.
 
 Examples: /getquote, /getquote -s stuff, /getquote -l username

**Saving pictures**

 Reply to a picture with the command `/seve` and I'll save it. I will send a confirmation when I save the photo with the ID#. If you want to tag the photo, add tags after the command.
 
 Examples: /seve, /seve cool pic

When you want to retrieve a picture, you can send /git, which I'll respond to with a random picture from my database. If you want to see a specific picture, you can use the -t argument with a tag from the original seve or the -i <##> where the ## is the ID number of the picture, which can be seen in my original seve confirmation message.

Examples: /git, /git -t cool, /git -i 47

**Emotes**

Sending a message starting with a single lowercase <e> will echo a message in the format <@yourusername message>

Example: e does a thing
Result: @username does a thing
